# Summary

A modular rack system for holding 3 BeagleBone Blacks per tray, each tray will slide out allowing you access to the headers and cables on each board, including wire management brackets to keep things tidy,  

More info at: https://linuxpropaganda.wordpress.com/2018/09/21/beaglebone-black-cluster-rack-system/

Use https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3105119 for connections to the power supply's located inside the stand

Use https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1320948 for the networking cables to keep things tidy

The PCB is used to distribute the 5v across each tray, each PCB requires 5 screw terminal blocks with a 3.5mm pin spacing.  The PCB may be ordered threw the Fritzing software. The file is included. https://aisler.net/p/NKVQDEAW

This is a 12 volt system, connected to a solar powered battery array with 4 12v DC to 5v DC step down boards housed in the stand next to a 16 relay board that allows the master node the ability to power up/down the slave nodes as needed,

Notes: 
I used a 3mm brim to keep the corners from curling up during printing, some of the parts are rather large however they are within the capacity of my Ultimaker 2+ machine.

The trays are removable by gently squeezing the arms inward from each side, I made the arms replaceable in the event one is broken at some point.

It is important that your machine is well calibrated to insure proper function of the sliding trays especially near the area where the arms are attached, you may have to shave that area as needed to allow for a smooth sliding tray.
